# 🔐 Why Use Zig for Encryption Apps?

Zig is a modern low-level programming language that's well-suited for building efficient, safe, and portable encryption tools — especially when simplicity and performance matter. If you are too foolish to use Rust, zig is almost a good option :) 

Zig is really cool — with just a few lines of code, you can do some incredibly powerful things. That said, I wish it had a larger development team. Right now, the Zig Software Foundation (a nonprofit) funds a small core group of paid contributors, but resources are limited compared to Rust. Zig still feels like it's in earlier stages of maturity, while Rust has massive corporate backing, millions in funding, and a huge developer community pouring effort into it. In the long run, objective reality  gives Rust the profound edge. I would imagine the super small team who makes a yearly salary from the "nonprofit" is in no hurry to stop getting the yearly money. Lets get real, most nonprofits are a scam to make a yearly salary. Moreover, when a select few make serious money, that is NOT non-profit, no matter what people call it.

## 🚀 Benefits of Using Zig for Encryption

### ⚡ 1. **Minimal Overhead**
- No runtime, GC, or hidden abstractions
- You control every byte and cycle
- Great for small, standalone CLI tools

### 🔧 2. **Powerful Standard Library**
- Includes fast and well-designed crypto primitives:
  - `std.crypto.aead.aes_gcm.Aes256Gcm`
  - Hashing (SHA-2, SHA-3, BLAKE2)
  - Secure random generation
- Built-in memory allocators and file I/O
- No need for OpenSSL or third-party bloat

### 🛡️ 3. **Safer Than C**
- Bounds-checked arrays (in debug mode)
- Option types for null safety (`?T`)
- Error unions enforce handling (`!void`)
- Explicit alloc/free — no implicit memory leaks

### 💡 4. **Great Developer Experience**
- Easy to start: single-file apps work out of the box
- Just run: `zig build-exe my_tool.zig`
- Cross-compilation built in
- Fast compilation (no cargo-like wait)

### 🔁 5. **Portable and Cross-Platform**
- Create native `.exe`, `.bin`, `.wasm`, or `.elf` files
- Compile for Windows, Linux, macOS from any OS
- No dynamic linking headaches

## ✅ When Zig is a Great Fit

- Small to medium-sized encryption tools
- Self-contained command-line apps
- File encryption/decryption utilities
- Low-level crypto experiments
- Projects where C is “too risky” and Rust is “too heavy”

---

## ⚠️ Things to Keep in Mind

- Zig doesn’t enforce memory safety like Rust
- No borrow checker or auto-freeing of memory
- You are responsible for lifecycle and correctness

> That said: Zig gives you **more safety than C**, with fewer hoops than Rust.

## 🧪 Example Use Case

Encrypting and decrypting files using AES-256-GCM:

```zig
const Aes256Gcm = std.crypto.aead.aes_gcm.Aes256Gcm;
// Encrypt plaintext with: nonce + key + tag
```

---

## 📘 Summary

Zig is:
- 🛠️ Low-level but readable
- 🔒 Secure by design (when used properly)
- 🧳 Perfect for tools that need to be fast, portable, and reliable

It's a fantastic choice for encryption tools when you want **control, performance, and simplicity** — without the overhead of C or Rust.
